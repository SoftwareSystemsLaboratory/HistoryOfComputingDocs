# Documentation for the  History of Computing project

This is source code for the documentation of the History of Computing project.

I'm using two repos since we will eventually start hosting the actual History of Computing website on pages eventually. 

It's split into two:

* The design philosophy
* The react code itself 

This is version 1.1, as it used to be hosted on Github Wiki, and is now hosted on Sphinx using a travis auto build.


Huge thanks to [Nicholas Synovic](https://github.com/NicholasSynovic) for carrying me on the Travis stuff.
